Find $m + n$.", "generated_responses": ["Let $S = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L\\}$. We are grouping the twelve letters into six pairs of letters. The two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order to form six two-letter words, and then those six words are listed alphabetically. We want to find the probability that the last word listed contains $G$.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of ways to form the six pairs. We can choose the first pair in $\\binom{12}{2}$ ways. Then we can choose the second pair in $\\binom{10}{2}$ ways, and so on. This gives us $\\binom{12}{2} \\binom{10}{2} \\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2}$ ways to choose the pairs. However, the order in which we choose the pairs does not matter, so we must divide by $6!$. Thus, the total number of ways to form the six pairs is\n$$ \\frac{\\binom{12}{2} \\binom{10}{2} \\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2}}{6!} = \\frac{\\frac{12 \\cdot 11}{2} \\cdot \\frac{10 \\cdot 9}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8 \\cdot 7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{2}}{6!} = \\frac{66 \\cdot 45 \\cdot 28 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 1}{720} = \\frac{7484400}{720} = 10395. $$\nHowever, we are given that the two letters in each pair are placed next to each other in alphabetical order. So, we only need to count the number of ways to partition the 12 letters into 6 pairs. This is given by\n$$ \\frac{\\binom{12}{2} \\binom{10}{2} \\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2}}{6!} = \\frac{12!}{2^6 \\cdot 6!} = \\frac{479001600}{64 \\cdot 720} = \\frac{479001600}{46080} = 10395. $$\nNow, we want to find the number of ways to form the six pairs such that the last word listed contains $G$. This means that $G$ is in the last pair. Let the last pair be $GX$, where $X$ is one of the letters $A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L$. There are 11 possible choices for $X$. Once we have chosen $X$, we have 10 letters remaining. We need to form 5 pairs from these 10 letters. The number of ways to do this is\n$$ \\frac{\\binom{10}{2} \\binom{8}{2} \\binom{6}{2} \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2}}{5!} = \\frac{10!}{2^5 \\cdot 5!} = \\frac{3628800}{32 \\cdot 120} = \\frac{3628800}{3840} = 945. $$\nSo, there are $11 \\cdot 945 = 10395$ ways to form the six pairs such that the last word listed contains $G$.\nHowever, we need to consider the alphabetical order of the six words. The total number of ways to list the six words alphabetically is $6!$.\nThe number of ways to form the six pairs is $\\frac{12!}{2^6 \\cdot 6!} = 10395$.\nThe number of ways to form the six pairs such that the last word contains $G$ is $11 \\cdot \\frac{10!}{2^5 \\cdot 5!} = 11 \\cdot 945 = 10395$.\nThe probability that the last word listed contains $G$ is $\\frac{11}{12-1} = \\frac{11}{11} = 1$. This is incorrect.\n\nLet's consider the probability that $G$ is in the last pair. There are 12 letters, so the probability that $G$ is in the last pair is $\\frac{1}{6}$.\nThe probability that $G$ is in the last pair is $\\frac{11}{11} = 1$.\nThe probability that $G$ is in the last
